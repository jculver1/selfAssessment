#Self Assessment - Block 1
1.What areas do you feel you are struggling the most in? (Be specific, technologies, habits, etc.)
    Making proper outlines when I tackle larger problems/projects. Working on homework after class. Using proper terminology when asking questions or talking about assignments. Accumulator patterns 

2.Develop a plan using S.M.A.R.T. goals to continue progress in the areas you mentioned above. S.M.A.R.T. - Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Timely.
    Practice sudo coding before diving into a problem. If I do not spend time before class working on projects, make sure to dedicate at least 1 hour after class. Practice using new terminology as soon as it’s introduced. Go back to some of the earlier accumulative patterns, do them from scratch, and compare how has my code changed? Also, do the same questions using Python. 

3.Look back at Block 1, choose 3 'aha' moments where something clicked and describe them below.
    Bootstraps clicked when I was working on the Bootstraps checkpoint. Before, I was using a combination of Bootstraps and Flexbox to make websites, but when I was forced to only use Bootstraps I was able to learn more about its capabilities. 
    Working on the pixel art maker, dom manipulation started to click. Just being able to practice creating elements with a for loop and being able to target an element and make a change helped me to better understand the flow of DOM manipulation. 
    Before this program, I only used the GUH, but now I barely use it. I was working with a friend last week, and she made a comment about how I ‘look like a developer’ because I rarely use the touchpad. 

4.What areas do you feel the most confident in? What is making you happy right now?
    CSS and HTML are the easiest areas for me right now, but also the least exciting. I enjoyed working on the Pixel Art Maker and Galvanize Eats because it gave me more freedom to figure things out on my own and see how things were working. Also being able to make a request for information and being able to display the response on a webpage is exciting!

5.What technologies/industries are you most excited about currently?
    Working more with API’s, working with data, Mongo DB, SQL
